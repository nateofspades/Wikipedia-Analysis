# Wikipedia-Analysis

In this project I wanted to use NLP to extract the most important sentences and individual words from various Wikipedia articles. In [Machine Learning Project Final Version.ipynb](https://github.com/nateofspades/Wikipedia-Analysis/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Project%20Final%20Version.ipynb) you will find 3 different approaches to extracting the most important sentences (**LexRank Summarizer**, **Luhn Summarizer**, **Latent Semantic Analysis Summarizer**) and 1 approach to extracting the most important words (**TextRank**).
